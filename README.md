This repository contains a subset of pre-trained MAX models that have been converted to the TensorFlow.js format.

> These files were created more as a learning exercise in TensorFlow.js and TensorFlow.js conversion. No guarantee is made that they are properly converted and ready to use. For ready-to-use TensorFlow.js models see [https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models)
